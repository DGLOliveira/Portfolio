It is meant to grow with time in both features and functionality, as well as show some of my skills and habilities. There are many plans for it, ranging from more customizability, applications and features, and eventually become a full stack OS that allows for connecting multiple users for shared work or multiplayer games, among others, without resorting to exposing users to security risks that come with screen sharing."
